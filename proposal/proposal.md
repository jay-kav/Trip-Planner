## Project Description:
Our innovative web application is designed to revolutionize the way people plan and experience their trips. Whether you are either a solo traveler or organizing a group holiday, our platform will provide you with a smooth and personalized trip-planning experience.
Creating and Managing Trips
When logging into the app, users have the option to create a new trip from scratch or access their ongoing or past trips. When creating a new trip, users specify the destination along with a start and end date. The trip's creator is automatically assigned as the 'trip leader,' which gives them exclusive control to manually adjust the itinerary.
### Smart Itinerary Generation
One of the standout features of our app is its intelligent schedule generation. Using an algorithm, the app creates a day-by-day schedule filled with exciting activities and attractions based on the chosen location. Users can filter activities by time frame and preference, ensuring that the itinerary perfectly aligns with their interests.
### API-Powered Recommendations
Our app will integrate effortlessly with APIs to fetch a wide array of activities and attractions available in the chosen area. The algorithm carefully selects a set of activities that can be accommodated within the user's desired schedule, ensuring an enjoyable trip.
### Technology Stack
The web app will use Python, Django, and SQL for the backend. On the front end, we employ JavaScript, React, and CSS Frameworks to deliver a sleek and user-friendly interface. We will then use Docker and Azure/AWS to deploy the web app.
### Collaborative Travel Planning
Acknowledging that travel is often a shared experience, our app allows users to invite others to join their trip. This collaborative feature enables sharing of the itinerary, making group travel a breeze.
